// Ballerina defines certain types as lax types, for which static typing rules are less strict.
// For example field access (`.`) and optional field access (`?.`), which are generally allowed on
// records and objects for fields that are defined in the type descriptors, are also additionally
// allowed on lax types, moving some of the type checking to runtime from compile time.
// `json` is defined to be a lax type along with any `map<T>` where `T` is a lax type.
