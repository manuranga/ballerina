# To run this sample, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file, and execute the `ballerina run` command.

# Use the ballerina `run` command to invoke the `main` function specifying `add`
# as the string argument for `operation` and `10` and `20` as the integer arguments
# with which the operation is to be performed. `10` would be set as the value for
# `initialValue` and `20` would be passed as an argument for the rest parameter.
$ ballerina run the_main_function.bal add 10 20
Result: 30

# Use the ballerina `run` command to invoke the `main` function specifying `add`
# as the string argument for `operation` and `40` as the integer value for
# `initialValue`. Both arguments are specified as named arguments.
$ ballerina run the_main_function.bal -operation=add -initialValue=40
Result: 40

# Use the ballerina `run` command to invoke the `main` function specifying `unknown op`
# as the string argument for `operation`. The `error` returned would be printed.
$ ballerina run the_main_function.bal "unknown op"
error unknown operation
